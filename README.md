# Keymaps

This is a collection of the QMK keymaps that I have created. Their main goal is to adapt the Brazilian keyboard layout ABNT2 to a variety of different keyboards, all of which support by default some sort of English layout.

If you want, you can download the keymap and place it in the keyboards directory in your qmk_firmware folder. It should be something like this: ~/QMK/qmk_firmware/keyboards/keyboard_name/keymap_name/keymap.c
